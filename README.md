Requirements for Current and Future Search Interfaces for German-speaking Users
=================================================================================

This repository contains the results of an exploratory study I have conducted for my PhD thesis in order to determine a set of requirements for current and future search interfaces for German-speaking users. In particular, you will find:

* the raw survey data, as collected through a Google Form;
* the combined and translated results in English, additionally divided into user groups "Desktop", "Mobile" and "Novel";
* the screenshots of the four search interfaces evaluated in the study, as they were shown to the participants;
* the survey results, findings and inferred initial requirements that were presented to 12 experts for verification; and
* the final set of requirements, as determined from the results of the study and verified by the 12 experts.
